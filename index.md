## P2P Selling has never been this easy

From time to time, there is this need you have to sell that console you don't use anymore, that big TV because you want to upgrade to a better one, or that pricey cellphone you bought last year but don't like anymore. You could be Alice.

Or you could be Bob, that wants to buy that console you don't want because you're giving such a good price and he's been saving up a little. 

But what if Alice doesn't really know Bob from that long ago, and Bob finds it hard to trust a stranger too? **We can't let that deal go undone can we?** 

### Let's trust the Blockchain!

I know what you are going to say, you've probably heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum and all those fancy names, but nobody has bothered to really explain it you with care. Well, we'll do so in a heartbeat.

Imagine we had a notebook where we could keep track of everything you and everyone owns. Such a notebook could be pretty cool, you could verify anytime you want who owns what and if anything has changed hands at any given time. Sounds neat so far, but **somebody would have to take care of that, isn't it?** Well, you are right. But the blockchain solves that problem by distributing copies of the notebook and updating each and everyone of those copies every time a change is made. Making changes onto the dsitributed notebook is hard **(nearly impossible actually)** and that makes it very secure.

Now that sounds like something you can trust!

### What is 'Alice and Bob'?

**Alice and Bob** is a Digital App that empowers individuals to exchange proof of ownership of whatever they want through the blockchain while also enabling digital payments through linking to bank accounts right on your smartphone. You just have to install the app and then do something like this:

1. Log in to your profile and you'll see your linked accounts and ownership keys acquired through previous purchases (if you have none, then, well, you'll have none and be very sad about it :( )
2. Choose to make a contract as _Alice_ **(Selling party)** or as _Bob_**(buying party)**
3. Go to a Waiting Room to link with each other through being physically close or with an invite code
4. Agree on Terms and the Smart Contract will be automatically made the App and be integrated to the Blockchain
5. Once the terms are fulfilled, both of you will receive a notification and **the deal will be done!**

**Is it really that easy?** Yes! You can check out a test-walk through a deal right [here](https://www.figma.com/file/GFEuv4obOqdc8q3cBi2to4/Alice-and-Bob?node-id=0%3A1) or [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/GFEuv4obOqdc8q3cBi2to4/Alice-and-Bob?node-id=3%3A2&scaling=scale-down) if that didn't work, sorry.

### What do you get?

- **Flexibility**: Pay on one go through linked credit or debit cards by the terms agreed on the contract. (On later versions we'll add a feature to let you pay through deposits on convenience stores, but don't tell anybody about it! It's a secret)
- **Verifiability**: Trust the Blockchain. Did we already say its **nearly impossible** to crack it?
- **Security**: Proof of ownership and verification of payment gets executed automatically by the Smart Contract created on the blockchain. You pay for what you get and receive what you paid for.
